                        <small>Face-Tune</small>
                        <p>This project aims to recognize human emotions using facial expression analysis and provide real-time music recommendations
                            based on the detected emotion. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to classify
                            emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger, and neutrality. 
                            The facial expression recognition is performed using OpenCV and Haar cascades for face detection. 
                            Have a look at the model:
